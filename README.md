blooket hacks by extremelydumb

This is a work in progress.
At the moment the only thing I've made is the thing that lets you set your blook to whatever you want.

To use it, you need to have Charles SSL proxying ENABLED and rewrite https://GAMEMODE.blooket.com/api/users/unlocks to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extremelydumb/blooket-hacks/main/unlockallblooks
// REPLACE GAMEMMODE WITH ONE OF THESE: cryptohack, goldquest, piratesvoyage, fishingfrenzy, towerdefense, towerdefense2, monsterbrawl, deceptivedinos, battleroyale, cafe, factory, racing, blookrush, classic
